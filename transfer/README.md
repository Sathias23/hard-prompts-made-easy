# PEZ Algorithm Implementation Guide

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of implementing the PEZ (hard **P**rompts made **E**a**Z**y) algorithm for optimizing text prompts using CLIP encoders and Stable Diffusion.

## Project Overview

The PEZ algorithm optimizes text prompts for image generation by using gradient-based discrete optimization. The process involves:
1. Taking an input image
2. Optimizing a text prompt using CLIP encoders
3. Using the optimized prompt with Stable Diffusion for image generation

## Directory Structure

- `implementation_details.md` - Key implementation considerations and code structure
- `configuration_guide.md` - Guide to configuration parameters and their effects
- `optimization_process.md` - Deep dive into the prompt optimization process
- `dependencies.md` - Required dependencies and setup instructions

## Key Components

1. **CLIP Integration**
   - Uses OpenCLIP for image-text similarity scoring
   - Supports multiple CLIP model variants (default: ViT-H-14)

2. **Optimization Process**
   - Gradient-based optimization of discrete text tokens
   - Configurable parameters for learning rate, iterations, and batch size

3. **Configuration System**
   - JSON-based configuration
   - Flexible image input handling
   - Customizable hyperparameters

## Getting Started

1. Review the `dependencies.md` for setup requirements
2. Study the `configuration_guide.md` to understand parameter tuning
3. Follow `implementation_details.md` for core implementation steps
4. Refer to `optimization_process.md` for fine-tuning the optimization

## Implementation Timeline

1. Set up dependencies and environment
2. Implement CLIP model loading and preprocessing
3. Create prompt optimization logic
4. Add configuration system
5. Integrate with image generation pipeline
6. Implement monitoring and logging

## Best Practices

1. Always validate input images before processing
2. Use appropriate batch sizes based on available memory
3. Monitor optimization progress with print_step parameter
4. Consider multiple optimization runs for better results
